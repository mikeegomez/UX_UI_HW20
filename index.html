        <h2>OVERVIEW</h2>
        <P>
          Friends of Sacramento Public Libraries is a community-based volunteer organization dedicated to advocating for Sacramento Public Library, and to raising funds for enhanced services at all library branches. They believe that public libraries play an important role in giving everyone a chance to succeed because they provide free access to materials and resources. They share the Library's belief that reading is fundamental to children's well-being, and that the community has a responsibility to ensure that all of our children learn to read fluently.
        </p>

        <p>
          Their proceeds help ensure that Sacramento public libraries have the ability to make the necessary upgardes to help maintain and improve the public library experience. Their proceeds help with new as paint, lighting, shelving, and other facility enhancements. 
            
        <p>
          This was a class project that I worked with fellow students in the UI/UX Boot Camp. We spent a large amount of our spare time and weekends collaborating with each other to build the vision.

            <h2>Problem</h2>
            <p>The charity and economic sustain is based on volunteer help through membership of the website, either money or people who contribute their knowledge on this worthy cause, but the non-profit organization receives a low percentage of visitors, and as a consequence, a low rate of donations.</p>

              <p>Our project is based on the redesign of Friends of Sacramento Libraries website, made to inform users about volunteer opportunites, sales events, and how to donate to the orgainzation. We want to provide tools that help improve the goals and help the library.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-sm-4">
            <h2>Goal</h2>
            <p>One of our goals is making this website easier to complete the orgazations mail goals - donate, attend an event and volunteer. We plan to acheive this goal by completely revamping the navigation and site menu to give users a clear path to acheive said goals. </p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-sm-4">
            <h2>Process</h2>
            <p>Through contextual research, user interviews and redesign process with the existing platform, we intended to:</p>
              <li>Document the offline and online donation processes, recluting of members and active voluntaries.</li>
              <li>Understand the usage context and user’s needs.</li>
              <li>Discover what worked well and bad with the current website.</li></p>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="container">
        <h2>RESEARCH</h2>
        <P>To start the case study, we needed to know how we could improve our website's feasibility.

          Firstly, we conducted a series of heuristic evaluations and conducted interviews to obtain usability data. Some key observations we took note of:
          
          1. How easy was is it to complete the following goals: donate, volunteer, attend an event? 
          2.How was the donation process? 
          3. Was the website easy to navigate and did the contents make sense? 
          
          After surveying participants and conducting five user interviews, we used affinity mapping to find common points in the data that we have collected. As per from result, we were able to discover significant facts that we need to address in the next cycle of our design process.</P>

    <h2 class="">Persona</h2>
    <p class="">After all research, we created an User persona, based on all the interviews and tests we did with people from all over the world remotely. They are our ideal person, who probably use the website to make a donation, participate in the non profit’s events, and volunteer.  </p>

    <h2>Empathy Mapping</h2>
    <p>We did an empathy mapping to gain user’s needs, pains, and gains. These helped us identify how our solutions could address them the problems. This way we have a clue about the strengths of the website and the weaknesses, which become opportunities to do something better.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="container">
  <h2>Current site analysis</h2>
  <P>
    We looked at the current website to determine their existing focus area and what could be improved to increase donors and address user needs. So, it’s not astonishing that the current website has several issues, which might reduce user involvement.
    Below you can see along with screenshots of the reviewing UX audit we did.</P>

  <div class="text">
    <p>Confusing navigation, where there were many multiple paths to find events, but not one consolidated page to find them all. 

      Broken links, or links open up to a word document. 
      No search bar, so users are not able to look up or navigate to sections easy. 
      
      Unpleasing color aesthetics - inconsistent button colors that clash with the main color scheme of the website. 
      
      Donation page is old fashioned and lacks basic security prompts to ensure users that donation site is safe. 
      
      Inconsistent event information. Sometimes it shows date and location, sometimes it does not. </p>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="container">
  <h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
  <P>
    We then used our design theories to do a comprehensive evaluation of competitors' websites, including national and local non profit groups. We began by looking at the placements of navigation bar buttons. This was an essential factor to consider for users to get involved. We noticed a typical design pattern where donation buttons were in a very prominent position on the home page, usually next to the mission statement. It helps the user to understand better what each organization’s motto is and how to donate to it immediately. We also analyzed other websites to observe how they showcased their information.</P>
